**Hi, this is Swapnil, and this is my submission for the Hack2Skill Hackathon: Acquisition Magnet.**

- This app demonstrates how you can create dynamic, personalized customer journeys based on the channel a user comes from.

**[Show the home screen with all channel cards]**

- On the home screen, you see all the main acquisition channels: Instagram, Google Ads, Facebook, LinkedIn, Referral, and Blog.

**[Tap on “Instagram”]**

- If a user comes from Instagram, they get a special onboarding message and offer just for Instagram users.

**[Go back, tap on “Referral”]**

- If they come from a referral, they see a different journey, with a bonus for both them and their friend.

**[Show a couple more channels]**

- Each channel has its own unique onboarding flow and message, making the experience feel personal and relevant.

**[End on the home screen]**

- This structure is ready to be extended with real deep link detection, analytics, and AI-powered personalization.
- Thank you for watching, and I hope you enjoyed this demo of Acquisition Magnet!
